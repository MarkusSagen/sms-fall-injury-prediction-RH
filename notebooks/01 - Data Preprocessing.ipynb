We have loved every single one of these fun sticker and activity books.  The Princess Grace Sticker and Activity Book was just as much fun as the other's.  These are books loaded with stickers, and fun activities to keep your child entertained.  They are great for traveling, or great for a quiet activity at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book is about Princess Grace, but it also includes the other princesses too.  Joy, Faith, Hope, and Charity, are featured in this book.  This book includes beautifully illustrated color pictures that my daughter really enjoyed.  The book has activities like finding the stickers to complete the picture.  The book also has a word search that has your child look for Grace's favorite things.  Their are also pages to color.  My daughter loved the coloring page with Grace and the kitties.  The book has a page where your child gets to draw their own vase full of beautiful flowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are just some of the great activities that you will find in the Princess Grace Sticker and Activity book.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the BookLook Bloggers book review bloggers program.

So I bought it and was so happy to see that they included all of Gibran's original illustrations in high quality. Also, the translation is SPOT ON and beautifully written!

       "1433920  43916       Disclosure - free sample provided.<br /><br />This is the third book in the series that we have received.  We have loved every single one of these fun sticker and activity books.  The Princess Grace Sticker and Activity Book was just as much fun as the other's.  These are books loaded with stickers, and fun activities to keep your child entertained.  They are great for traveling, or great for a quiet activity at home.<br /><br />This book is about Princess Grace, but it also includes the other princesses too.  Joy, Faith, Hope, and Charity, are featured in this book.  This book includes beautifully illustrated color pictures that my daughter really enjoyed.

       "1433922  43916       Nicely packaged. It's about 50/50 with good verses not so great illustrations.

       "1433923  43916       Ms. Scranton's book shed some seriously needed light on the deep dark secret world of quick books add-on integration.  I was always very intimidated by the prospect of making all this stuff work together.  Ms. Scranton's book make it seem very possible that I could actually pull it off.  That is not even the best part.  As a result of reading the book I contacted Ms. Scranton for some extra advice.  She is brilliant!  Her understanding and knowledge of quick books and its add-ons is remarkable.  All I can say is read this book and call her.

       "1433924  43916       I bought this book as a present for my Australian wife. I always told her that the old translation we had by Khairallah was missing many verses and tried to translate it for her myself. When I saw this book on Amazon, I was so happy to read: &#34;complete&#34; and &#34;accurate&#34;. So I bought it and was so happy to see that they included all of Gibran's original illustrations in high quality. Also, the translation is SPOT ON and beautifully written! I found myself comparing the Arabic in the back of the book to the corresponding English verse. I think this deserves to be acknowledged as a great work in English poetry by itself and not just as a fantastic translation. I highly, highly recommend it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 0.0       \n",

       "1434012  43916       When you study Malcolm X, and follow the tracks of his life, and his dedication to the truth, he was a definite threat to the Nation of Islam, and the United States government. He truly wanted to solve the race issue in America, which he connected to the World. Since his death, the current batch of &#34;civil rights&#34; leaders have done nothing like he did. That  to me is the true test of them. They have become soft and comfortable, and are not willing to put themselves out for anyone,much less another Black person, no matter what they say.As Malcolm said &#34;when they drop those dollars on you, your soul goes.&#34; A good book to have which shows what kind of &#34;democracy&#34; America is, and what happens if you speak out about America.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      0.0       \n",

Shadowscape deck is the thinnest card stock I own and second most used professionl deck.&lt;br /&gt;Somewhat strays from the RWS so it's a very intuitive deck  so depends on what you prefer or like. (Could be a benefit)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the books is quite poetic she has a tendency to ramble about on about nothing, her book lacks depth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephanie Pui Mon Law is an incredible fantasy artist. I would prefer higher quality materials as you never know when the deck may stop printing in my opinion. And to me it's an insult to the artist material. Please do a deluxe version!&lt;br /&gt;My deck already has a bend to it and looks scratched.  I look after all my decks. Paper the thinnest I've ever owned and the silver boarders can scratch off so be careful with this.  The artwork is finely detailed and extremely beautiful I can understand that people find this deck difficult to see and even with my good eye sight. I have a tendency to stare a lot longer then other decks. I wish this came in a deluxe slightly bigger size lets pressure the artist he he!</td>\n",

At first i was upset with the ending until i learned it's the first book of the series. I will definitely be reading the second book, I can't wait to read what happens next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story follows Jayden, a desert girl from Mesopotamian. She was betrothed to her cousin and future king of her tribe Horeb (a selfish and power hungry man). Life with Horeb would bring Jayden and her family wealth and power but she does not love or even like Horeb. She falls in love with the generous and kind hearted stranger Kadesh, and realizes that she has to somehow get out of her betrothal to Horeb (an impossible task). I can understand why her father wouldn't break the wedding contract to Horeb, but he was acting out of desperation and did not have his daughter's best interest at heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jayden loses everything - her family, her tribe and her home. She goes through so much but still remains strong and tries to hold her family together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The author developed the characters well and was very descriptive without being boring, I like her writing style. The story was heartbreaking and at times upsetting but sprinkled with hope. I really enjoyed this book, I got hooked immediately and couldn't put it down.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The market is just saturated with step-brother romances right now and I have read quite a few of them.

The images feels other worldly sci fi like I dropped into the most glorious dream<br />No dark scary imaginary<br />Beautiful fairies and  mermaids in the cups. All grouped together by animal/fantasy and colours.<br />Its somewhat divers with people which is a joy to see ( a few men, Asians and Africans) yeah!<br />I have found this deck great for spiritual reads, and path work.<br />Has a quite voice that is profoundly clear with its message, beautiful readings!<br />Close to the RWS but original it's own self and vibe<br />Very intuitive deck<br /><br />Cons<br />Flimsy and card stock. It's greatest down fall in my opinion!<br />I want a deluxe version with better card stock. Shadowscape deck is the thinnest card stock I own and second most used professionl deck.<br />Somewhat strays from the RWS so it's a very intuitive deck  so depends on what you prefer or like. (Could be a benefit)<br /><br />As the books is quite poetic she has a tendency to ramble about on about nothing, her book lacks depth.<br /><br />Stephanie Pui Mon Law is an incredible fantasy artist. I would prefer higher quality materials as you never know when the deck may stop printing in my opinion. And to me it's an insult to the artist material. Please do a deluxe version!<br />My deck already has a bend to it and looks scratched.  I look after all my decks. Paper the thinnest I've ever owned and the silver boarders can scratch off so be careful with this.  The artwork is finely detailed and extremely beautiful I can understand that people find this deck difficult to see and even with my good eye sight. I have a tendency to stare a lot longer then other decks. I wish this came in a deluxe slightly bigger size lets pressure the artist he he! NaN          F              88         \n",

Does Horeb find Jayden? Will Jayden be reunited with either sister? I have so many questions. At first i was upset with the ending until i learned it's the first book of the series. I will definitely be reading the second book, I can't wait to read what happens next.<br /><br />The story follows Jayden, a desert girl from Mesopotamian. She was betrothed to her cousin and future king of her tribe Horeb (a selfish and power hungry man). Life with Horeb would bring Jayden and her family wealth and power but she does not love or even like Horeb. She falls in love with the generous and kind hearted stranger Kadesh, and realizes that she has to somehow get out of her betrothal to Horeb (an impossible task). I can understand why her father wouldn't break the wedding contract to Horeb, but he was acting out of desperation and did not have his daughter's best interest at heart.<br /><br />Jayden loses everything - her family, her tribe and her home. She goes through so much but still remains strong and tries to hold her family together.<br /><br />The author developed the characters well and was very descriptive without being boring, I like her writing style. The story was heartbreaking and at times upsetting but sprinkled with hope. I really enjoyed this book, I got hooked immediately and couldn't put it down.

I'd definitely recommend this book to a friend (and already told both my roommates they need to read it).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          0.0         M              83         "

But those cases are not counted here. In the original dataset, from 302 total recorded fall injuries in 2016, by only including the first fall injury for a patient, the number of fall injuries went down to 244\n",
    "2. Since a patient may fall very early on in their stay at the hospital, and we, therefore, only include those early journal entries, there could be an issue with highly imbalanced datasets in terms of how many journal entries a patient has in total when predicting future fall injuries."

Bought 4 different packs (numbers, colors &amp; shapes, Alphabet and first words) for grandchild.  Will give to her as little gifts to have for travel and something we can play together. As good as it gets. Simple. Clear. Works. Clearly does not have any idea what he is writing about. Seems to be focused on grapes in an almost fetishistic manner, and has no idea what a hat looks like. Kendall Uyeji is a new mind in the world of modern writing, which causes fluctuations of trust to make the reader feel bad. Levin does a wonderful job of introducing you to the characters and how their personal lives provide angst and motivation to do their difficult jobs.  The interplay between the characters provides a wonderful web to the horrific mystery they are called on to solve.  The book is realistic, fun, thought provoking and moves at a wonderful pace.  I felt like I knew the characters and places they lived and worked.  The most touching part of the story remains between the main Character Preuss and his special needs child Toby.  The tenderness, understanding and deep parental love seems to provide Pruess a deep centering in his difficult chaotic life.  I so enjoyed how Levin takes the reader on a journey of what everyday life is like--the ugliness, the petty bickering, the frustrations, the hopes, the joys and the willingness to sacrifice.  A wonderful book! a quite story line of people holding hands. its about 100 b/w photographs of people holding hands. a number of them will put happy tears in your eyes. very refreshing it goes back when you are young forward when you get older and when you are still in between life. again very refreshing.</td>\n",

I haven't had time to read it, but I look forward to it. Arrived with no problems. Thank you. Perhaps I can say more later. Great gift for the F1 fan. All of these thing are Christmas presents. I cannot tell you much of aything about how well yhey were received. The dentist loved the book and was looking forward to using it for her classes. Whayt I need to know Last year I picked up THREAT VECTOR on a whim. It was the first Clancy book I'd read in ages. It was also the first novel I'd read that was written by Mark Greaney. I absolutely loved it. After reading THREAT VECTOR I went and bought all of Greaney's solo Gray Man novels. I read the four Gray Man books over the course of a month. I decided to wait until COMMAND AUTHORITY came out in mass market paperback before reading it -- I have a nice hardback for the collection but I hate lugging around those thick hardcovers when I do most of my reading on the bus. I picked up another copy of COMMAND AUTHORITY when it was released in paperback and devoured it in a week. COMMAND AUTHORITY continues the standard of excellence I have come to expect of Greaney's writing. It comes across as a very timely read given the events in Ukraine over the past year. COMMAND AUTHORITY is fast paced and well plotted. I felt that the inclusion of the Jack Ryan Sr. murder investigation subplot 30 years in the past was a nice touch. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and everything leading up to it is thrilling. It took a hundred or so pages for me to really get into the book but once I was hooked it was impossible to put down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know there are a still a lot of people complaining about Greaney writing under the Clancy name now that Tom is dead but it is also apparent that there are a lot more people that support Greaney and will continue to do so. I believe that Greaney has done an honor to the Clancy franchise and I hope he keeps writing about Jack Ryan Sr/Jr for a long time to come. Good book with decent coverage of functional programming in F# and the functional capabilities added to C#. The book is well written, and easy to understand.  The book teaches dog training using positive reinforcement, and compassion.  The instructions are clear and easy to follow. very good and accurate 90% of the times, worst reading Great book for making me think about unique business ideas. Really good info about the value of building a following. A fun story balanced with solid how-to material. What a wonderful book!

It may not be this way for others, but I find the font very, very difficult to read. There are smaller fonts that are much easier to read (I have a pocket GNT with a very small font I can read). I can only read this in the brightest of lights. Obviously, this is not true for other reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, though, this is a steal.

My one improvement suggestion is to perforate the pages so they can be easily removed. We take them out one at a time, put something underneath (because our markers bleed through), and color away. Thanks, Walter, for many hours of beautiful fun. Takes awhile to put all his messages together about compassion and people.  Second read is necessary but it is very thought provoking  and good. Timely delivery! Just as advertised. Samuel Renihan has done a great service to the church: he has taken what has been misunderstood and neglected  (the confessional statement &amp;#34;God...without passions&amp;#34;), and has ably and graciously explained it. In what is a most enjoyable and clear treatment of the doctrine of divine impassibility, Samuel Renihan has shown its exegetical and theological foundation. As well, he generously sprinkles quotes from older writers which demonstrate the doctrine's historical attestation in the church. Finally, there is a practical and pastoral section that shows what ought to be obvious: those who neglect theology proper have removed a vital element that is necessary for genuine Christian living. In my estimation, the most important aspect of this book, however, is the demonstration of the theological method involved at arriving at the biblical doctrine. May God use this work to further inform His people concerning this most important, and most blessed truth. Heled me get through a difficult break up.... Delivered on time what a good book.tapping and pain relief go hand in hand well done nick This book is sweet from cover to cover.  We read it to our 15-month-old son a few times each week and it is clear he likes both the repetition and the simple but expressive pictures.  Lovely. I love this book! Olivia is a great author and I cannot wait until her next one. I love Hattie Green. I couldn't put the book down. I am recommending this book to all my friends and family!!! This book is a great follow up to Unbroken.  A more personal account, written by Louis. Dr. Wolfe  baldly lays out what food is for us, especially its purpose as fuel and the many herbs and spices that also play a vital function in healing and caring for  this amazing enterprise we call our body. I could never test all she claims, but i do know she is a straight shooter, and  I am now looking at the food I eat with new fascination and interest.

       "0  21  Perfect! Looked and looked for this book. Engaging and super for close reading for details with kids. This is a great start for primary student animal reports. Bought 4 different packs (numbers, colors & shapes, Alphabet and first words) for grandchild.  Will give to her as little gifts to have for travel and something we can play together. As good as it gets. Simple. Clear. Works. Clearly does not have any idea what he is writing about. Seems to be focused on grapes in an almost fetishistic manner, and has no idea what a hat looks like. Kendall Uyeji is a new mind in the world of modern writing, which causes fluctuations of trust to make the reader feel bad. Levin does a wonderful job of introducing you to the characters and how their personal lives provide angst and motivation to do their difficult jobs.  The interplay between the characters provides a wonderful web to the horrific mystery they are called on to solve.  The book is realistic, fun, thought provoking and moves at a wonderful pace.  I felt like I knew the characters and places they lived and worked.  The most touching part of the story remains between the main Character Preuss and his special needs child Toby.  The tenderness, understanding and deep parental love seems to provide Pruess a deep centering in his difficult chaotic life.  I so enjoyed how Levin takes the reader on a journey of what everyday life is like--the ugliness, the petty bickering, the frustrations, the hopes, the joys and the willingness to sacrifice.  A wonderful book! a quite story line of people holding hands. its about 100 b/w photographs of people holding hands. a number of them will put happy tears in your eyes. very refreshing it goes back when you are young forward when you get older and when you are still in between life. again very refreshing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  67    0      1       67 \n",

       "2  24  great way to teach kids classical music through story telling Good message.  A bit simplistic, but a fun read for sales people.  It can be a great training tool. I haven't had time to read it, but I look forward to it. Arrived with no problems. Thank you. Perhaps I can say more later. Great gift for the F1 fan. All of these thing are Christmas presents. I cannot tell you much of aything about how well yhey were received. The dentist loved the book and was looking forward to using it for her classes. Whayt I need to know Last year I picked up THREAT VECTOR on a whim. It was the first Clancy book I'd read in ages. It was also the first novel I'd read that was written by Mark Greaney. I absolutely loved it. After reading THREAT VECTOR I went and bought all of Greaney's solo Gray Man novels. I read the four Gray Man books over the course of a month. I decided to wait until COMMAND AUTHORITY came out in mass market paperback before reading it -- I have a nice hardback for the collection but I hate lugging around those thick hardcovers when I do most of my reading on the bus. I picked up another copy of COMMAND AUTHORITY when it was released in paperback and devoured it in a week. COMMAND AUTHORITY continues the standard of excellence I have come to expect of Greaney's writing. It comes across as a very timely read given the events in Ukraine over the past year. COMMAND AUTHORITY is fast paced and well plotted. I felt that the inclusion of the Jack Ryan Sr. murder investigation subplot 30 years in the past was a nice touch. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and everything leading up to it is thrilling. It took a hundred or so pages for me to really get into the book but once I was hooked it was impossible to put down.<br /><br />I know there are a still a lot of people complaining about Greaney writing under the Clancy name now that Tom is dead but it is also apparent that there are a lot more people that support Greaney and will continue to do so. I believe that Greaney has done an honor to the Clancy franchise and I hope he keeps writing about Jack Ryan Sr/Jr for a long time to come. Good book with decent coverage of functional programming in F# and the functional capabilities added to C#. The book is well written, and easy to understand.  The book teaches dog training using positive reinforcement, and compassion.  The instructions are clear and easy to follow. very good and accurate 90% of the times, worst reading Great book for making me think about unique business ideas. Really good info about the value of building a following. A fun story balanced with solid how-to material. What a wonderful book! Fabulous characters, beautiful illustrations and an incredible story full of great lessons! A book I must have close by.  131   0      1       72 \n",
       "3  28  This is a fun read on a fun topic by an interesting author. Thanks to Mr. Dykes for the clear translation! Great book, easy read and very enjoyable story line interesting read on how big parma manipulates us to spend alot of money so they have huge profits Speedy delivery with no mistakes. The book is fabulous!  The cover was pretty worn around the edges, but I'd much rather buy used.  Thanks This the LXX and official Orthodox Greek New Testament together. It's very hard to come by this, and for this price you can't beat it.<br /><br />I have one significant gripe: the font. Otherwise this would be a full 5-star. It may not be this way for others, but I find the font very, very difficult to read. There are smaller fonts that are much easier to read (I have a pocket GNT with a very small font I can read). I can only read this in the brightest of lights. Obviously, this is not true for other reviewers.<br /><br />Overall, though, this is a steal. This is a great book that keeps the ideas simple and easy to consume.  A lot of great tips, pointers, reminders and actionable ideas anyone can incorporate!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  89    0      0       56 \n",
       "4  29  one of my mainstay devotionals This book is really fun. I have to keep it hidden do the older grand kids won't see it and want to color themselves. My one improvement suggestion is to perforate the pages so they can be easily removed. We take them out one at a time, put something underneath (because our markers bleed through), and color away. Thanks, Walter, for many hours of beautiful fun. Takes awhile to put all his messages together about compassion and people.  Second read is necessary but it is very thought provoking  and good. Timely delivery! Just as advertised. Samuel Renihan has done a great service to the church: he has taken what has been misunderstood and neglected  (the confessional statement &#34;God...without passions&#34;), and has ably and graciously explained it. In what is a most enjoyable and clear treatment of the doctrine of divine impassibility, Samuel Renihan has shown its exegetical and theological foundation. As well, he generously sprinkles quotes from older writers which demonstrate the doctrine's historical attestation in the church. Finally, there is a practical and pastoral section that shows what ought to be obvious: those who neglect theology proper have removed a vital element that is necessary for genuine Christian living. In my estimation, the most important aspect of this book, however, is the demonstration of the theological method involved at arriving at the biblical doctrine. May God use this work to further inform His people concerning this most important, and most blessed truth. Heled me get through a difficult break up.... Delivered on time what a good book.tapping and pain relief go hand in hand well done nick This book is sweet from cover to cover.  We read it to our 15-month-old son a few times each week and it is clear he likes both the repetition and the simple but expressive pictures.  Lovely. I love this book! Olivia is a great author and I cannot wait until her next one. I love Hattie Green. I couldn't put the book down. I am recommending this book to all my friends and family!!! This book is a great follow up to Unbroken.  A more personal account, written by Louis. Dr. Wolfe  baldly lays out what food is for us, especially its purpose as fuel and the many herbs and spices that also play a vital function in healing and caring for  this amazing enterprise we call our body. I could never test all she claims, but i do know she is a straight shooter, and  I am now looking at the food I eat with new fascination and interest. Excellent series I would recommend to anyone JUST THE INFO I WAS LOOKING FOR.                                                                                                                                                                             117   0      0       76 "
